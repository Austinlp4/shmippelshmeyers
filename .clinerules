# Cline Rules: Shmipple Shmeyers Beans Project

## Project Intelligence & Patterns

### Core Project Philosophy
- **Simplicity First**: This is intentionally a simple, static marketing site
- **Performance Critical**: 1-second FCP target on mobile 4G is non-negotiable
- **No Over-Engineering**: Resist adding complexity - vanilla HTML/CSS/JS only
- **Image Budget**: 300KB total is a hard constraint, not a suggestion

### User Preferences & Workflow
- **Modern Creative Layouts**: User prefers animations and dislikes boring section/card-based designs
- **No src Directory**: When creating Next.js projects, user prefers app directory structure directly
- **PostgreSQL Over Supabase**: User prefers PostgreSQL for database operations
- **AdFury.ai Theme**: Project uses orange primary color (#FF6B35), Inter font, and specific component classes

### Critical Implementation Paths
- **Single Page Architecture**: Everything must work on single index.html with smooth-scroll navigation
- **Anchor Navigation**: Use #why, #about, #products, #contact for section anchors
- **Mobile-First**: Always start with mobile constraints and scale up
- **WebP/AVIF**: All images must be optimized to these formats

### Known Constraints & Challenges
- **No Backend**: Absolutely no server-side functionality - static only
- **No Forms**: Contact must be mailto: links only
- **No CMS**: All content is hardcoded in HTML
- **Timeline Pressure**: 5-day sprint timeline requires efficient decisions

### Development Workflow
- **Memory Bank First**: Always read memory bank files before starting any task
- **Documentation Updates**: Update activeContext.md and progress.md after significant changes
- **Performance Testing**: Use Lighthouse for ongoing performance validation
- **Accessibility**: Basic WCAG AA compliance is required, not optional

### Asset Management Patterns
- **Image Organization**: Separate folders for hero/, products/, about/ images
- **Optimization Workflow**: Convert to WebP/AVIF and track against 300KB budget
- **Font Strategy**: Subset fonts to used characters only for performance

### Code Organization Preferences
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No libraries or frameworks for interactions
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Use for consistent theming and colors
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading hierarchy and landmark elements
- **Critical CSS**: Inline critical styles for above-fold content

### Quality Gates
- **Performance**: Must pass Lighthouse performance audit
- **Accessibility**: Must pass basic keyboard navigation and screen reader tests
- **Browser Testing**: Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Mobile Testing**: Verify on actual mobile devices, not just dev tools

### Evolution Considerations
- **Future E-commerce**: Architecture should allow for future shopping cart addition
- **Content Updates**: Consider how client will update product information
- **Analytics**: Plan for optional analytics integration

## Memory Bank Maintenance
- **Active Context**: Update after each major milestone
- **Progress**: Update after completing any checklist items
- **System Patterns**: Update if architectural decisions change
- **Tech Context**: Update if dependencies or tools change

This project prioritizes speed, simplicity, and performance above all else. When in doubt, choose the simpler solution that maintains performance goals.
